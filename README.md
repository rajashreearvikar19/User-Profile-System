# User Profile System-
 Created an interactive user profile card system using react component that displays user information and allows users to switch between different profiles.

### Key Features:
- Implemented a user search functionality, enabling efficient user lookup.
- Enhanced user experience with sliding cards that showcase individual profiles.
- Selecting a user card triggers an intuitive highlighting effect, drawing attention to the chosen card.
- Clicking on a user card not only highlights it but also displays a distinctive blue box around the selected card.
- Introduced a "Show All" button that offers a convenient way to view all profiles at once. This button becomes available when a particular profile is selected, allowing users to quickly access the entire collection of profiles.
- Each card provides comprehensive information, including the user's name, profile picture, contact details, and address.
- Achieved a polished interface by incorporating smooth transitions and animations during profile navigation.
